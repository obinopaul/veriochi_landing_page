# Veriochi - The AI Workspace

**Your AI. Your Studios. One Workspace.**

## 🚀 Mission

Our mission is to eliminate the fragmentation of modern work. Instead of juggling dozens of disconnected tools and AI chats, Veriochi offers a **persistent memory** layer that travels with you. Your context, preferences, and project history are shared across all Studios, making your AI assistants truly helpful teammates.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Persistent Memory
Unlike traditional AI tools that forget you after every session, Veriochi remembers. Your project context, brand voice, and technical preferences are preserved across all interactions.

### 🎨 Specialized AI Studios
Veriochi features dedicated environments for specific workflows:
- **Scribe Studio**: For writing, documentation, and content creation.
- **Canvas Studio**: For UI/UX design and visual assets.
- **Forge Studio**: For product prototyping and strategy.
- **Code Studio**: For full-stack development and engineering.

### 🤝 Unified Workspace
Bring your own API keys or use our managed compute. Veriochi integrates with your existing file systems and tools, creating a central hub for all your creative output.
